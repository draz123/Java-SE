##Internet chat

Program allows to create chatrooms, where we can talk to each other. 

Manual connect button is used to fast connect to specified host and port. 
Generally, program automatically looking for rooms on localhost, and when 
we connect to other host it doing the same on the specified machine. When
we are in chatroom, we see when somebody join, disconnect or change nick.
